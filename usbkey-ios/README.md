# Cowstick usbkey

This USB-key is part of the cowstick boards family. It is a very compact and
low-cost module that allow to connect and communicate with many serial ports
(like ICSP, JTAG, SPI, SWD, ...) over USB. This module can also be used with
cowlab tools to offer a user-friendly interface :)
