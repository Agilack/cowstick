# Cowstick

The goal of Cowstick project is to create usefull tools for microcontroller
and FPGA development, for example JTAG/SWD probes, serial port adapter ...
This tools are not revolutionnary in their functions but offer a more
user-friendly approach based on network communication.

## usbkey-ios

This is the first member of cowstick familly. At this time, this key is only
a proof of concept. It contains a microcontroller with USB interface, and
many configurable IOs.
